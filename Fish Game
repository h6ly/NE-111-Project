"""
This program has three data structures to represent the player, enemy squirrels, and grass background objects. The data structures are dictionaries with the following keys:

Keys used by all three data structures:
    'x' - the left edge coordinate of the object in the game world (not a pixel coordinate on the screen)
    'y' - the top edge coordinate of the object in the game world (not a pixel coordinate on the screen)
    'rect' - the pygame.Rect object representing where on the screen the object is located.
Player data structure keys:
    'surface' - the pygame.Surface object that stores the image of the squirrel which will be drawn to the screen.
    'facing' - either set to LEFT or RIGHT, stores which direction the player is facing.
    'size' - the width and height of the player in pixels. (The width & height are always the same.)
    'bounce' - represents at what point in a bounce the player is in. 0 means standing (no bounce), up to BOUNCERATE (the completion of the bounce)
    'health' - an integer showing how many more times the player can be hit by a larger squirrel before dying.
Enemy Squirrel data structure keys:
    'surface' - the pygame.Surface object that stores the image of the squirrel which will be drawn to the screen.
    'movex' - how many pixels per frame the squirrel moves horizontally. A negative integer is moving to the left, a positive to the right.
    'movey' - how many pixels per frame the squirrel moves vertically. A negative integer is moving up, a positive moving down.
    'width' - the width of the squirrel's image, in pixels
    'height' - the height of the squirrel's image, in pixels
    
Grass data structure keys:
    'grassImage' - an integer that refers to the index of the pygame.Surface object in GRASSIMAGES used for this grass object
